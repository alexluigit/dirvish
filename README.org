* Introduction

#+begin_quote
The experience of dirvish is surreal and even bizarre after all these years of
trying to use dired. Like how professionals make their craft look easy, dirvish
does something similar with how it builds on dired. Dirvish is paradoxical in
that it provides a completely different experience while still fundamentally
being dired at its core.

Dirvish is an improved version of the Emacs inbuilt package [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][Dired]].  It not only
gives Dired an appealing and highly customizable user interface, but also comes
together with almost all possible parts required for full usability as a modern
file manager.

* Prerequisites

This package requires =GNU ls= (~gls~) *on BSDs* for it to work properly, as an
example, one can install it via ~brew install coreutils~ on macOS.

Some [[file:docs/EXTENSIONS.org][extensions]] provide extra preview methods or commands that use external
tools, so it's highly recommended to install [[https://github.com/alexluigit/dirvish/blob/main/docs/EXTENSIONS.org#prerequisites][dependencies]] for them too.

* Installation

Dirvish is available on [[https://melpa.org/#/dirvish][Melpa]].  Just type =M-x package-install RET dirvish RET=
into Emacs 27.1+.  =el-get= users can get the recipe from [[https://github.com/alexluigit/dirvish/issues/90][here]].

For straight.el users, it is simply:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package 'dirvish)
#+end_src

* Quickstart

After installation, let Dirvish take over Dired globally:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(dirvish-override-dired-mode)
#+end_src

+ =M-x= ~dired~ | ~dired-jump~ | ... gives you a "dirvish-ish" Dired buffer/session
+ =M-x= ~dirvish~ gives you a 3-pane (parent+current+preview) session
+ Press =?= in a dirvish buffer to see the list of available commands

Now enjoy your brand-new Dired, or if you will, call it Dirvish 🐱.
