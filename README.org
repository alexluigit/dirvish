#+html: <p align="center">A <i>polished</i> <b>Dired</b> with batteries included</p>

* Introduction

Dirvish enhances Emacs' built-in Dired mode, providing a visually appealing and
highly customizable interface.  More than just a facelift, Dirvish delivers a
comprehensive suite of features, transforming Dired into a modern and fully
functional file manager.

#+begin_quote
The experience of dirvish is surreal and even bizarre after all these years of
trying to use dired. Like how professionals make their craft look easy, dirvish
does something similar with how it builds on dired. Dirvish is paradoxical in
that it provides a completely different experience while still fundamentally
being dired at its core.

* Installation

Dirvish is available from [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/dirvish.html][Nongnu-Elpa]] and [[https://melpa.org/#/dirvish][Melpa]].  You can install it directly
via =M-x package-install RET dirvish RET= on Emacs 28.1+.  After installation,
activate Dirvish globally with =M-x dirvish-override-dired-mode RET=.

* Quickstart

+ =M-x dirvish RET=

  Welcome to Dirvish!  Use your favorite dired commands here, press ~q~ to quit.

+ =M-x dirvish-dwim RET=

  Works the same as ~dirvish~ when the selected window is the only window;
  otherwise, it avoids occupying the entire frame.

+ =M-x dirvish-dispatch RET=

  This is a help/cheatsheet menu powered by ~transient.el~, the same library used
  to implement keyboard-driven menus in Magit and many Dirvish extensions.  If
  you prefer this interaction style, consider binding these menus to
  ~dirvish-mode-map~.  See [[file:docs/CUSTOMIZING.org][example config]] for details.

* Acknowledgements

This package draws inspiration from the terminal file manager [[https://github.com/ranger/ranger][ranger]].  Some
extensions began as rewrites of packages from [[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks][dired-hacks]], but have since been
significantly enhanced.
