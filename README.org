* Introduction

#+begin_quote
The experience of dirvish is surreal and even bizarre after all these years of
trying to use dired. Like how professionals make their craft look easy, dirvish
does something similar with how it builds on dired. Dirvish is paradoxical in
that it provides a completely different experience while still fundamentally
being dired at its core.

-- @noctuid ([[https://github.com/alexluigit/dirvish/issues/34][source]])

Dirvish is an improved version of the Emacs inbuilt package [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][Dired]].  It not only
gives Dired an appealing and highly customizable user interface, but also comes
together with almost all possible parts required for full usability as a modern
file manager.

* Installation

Dirvish is available from [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/dirvish.html][Nongnu-Elpa]] and [[https://melpa.org/#/dirvish][Melpa]].  You can install it directly
via =M-x package-install RET dirvish RET= on Emacs 28.1+.  After installation,
activate Dirvish globally with =M-x dirvish-override-dired-mode RET=.

* Quickstart

+ =M-x dirvish RET=

  Welcome to Dirvish!  Use your favorite dired commands here!

+ =M-x dired= | =dired-jump= | ... =RET=

  Dirvish takes care all of your Dired entries.

+ =M-x dirvish-dwim RET=

  If the selected window is the only window, open Dirvish, otherwise open Dired.

+ =M-x dirvish-dispatch RET=

  This is a help/cheatsheet menu powered by ~transient.el~, the same library used
  to implement keyboard-driven menus in Magit and many Dirvish extensions.  If
  you prefer this interaction style, consider binding these menus to
  ~dirvish-mode-map~.  See [[file:docs/CUSTOMIZING.org][example config]] for details.

* Documentation

* Acknowledgements

This package took inspiration from the terminal file manager [[https://github.com/ranger/ranger][ranger]] and [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][treemacs]]
from Alexander Miller.  Some of the extensions was initially a rewrite of
packages provided by [[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks][dired-hacks]]. These extensions have been greatly enhanced in
comparison to the original versions.
