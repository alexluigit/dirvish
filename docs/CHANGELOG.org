* 2.0.53

** Breaking changes

+ Use simulated dired buffers for parent directory and directory preview

  Prior to V2.0, `dirvish` command would create a ton of dired buffers because
  `dired-noselect` function were used to generate parent buffers and preview
  buffers for directory entries.  Now these buffers are created internally by
  dirvish, meaning they'll not showing up as dired/dirvish buffers in your
  buffer list.
