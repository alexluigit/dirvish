Consult the docstring of the options for details.

** Extra attributes

List of file attributes such as ~file-size~ showing in Dirvish file lines.  The
attributes are defined by ~dirvish-define-attribute~, you can get all available
attributes by evaluating:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(progn (mapc #'require `dirvish-extra-libs') (describe-variable 'dirvish--available-attrs))
#+end_src

To change the attributes session-locally, see [[#Transient based help menu (dirvish-menu.el)][dirvish-menu]].

** Preview dispatchers

The variable ~dirvish-preview-dispatchers~ determines how file preview works in
Dirvish.

Preview dispatchers are defined by ~dirvish-define-preview~. It holds a function
that takes current filename and dirvish session as arguments and gets called at
runtime when the preview window is available.  It controls how the preview
content for certain filetypes are generated, or it can decline to handle the
file name and leaving it for future dispatchers. If none of the dispatchers can
handle the preview, the fallback dispatcher named ~default~ is used.

The default value of ~dirvish-preview-dispatchers~ looks something like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(directory-exa text gif image video audio epub archive pdf-tools)
#+end_src

Let's say you don't like the preview directory result provided by ~exa~ shell
command, you can remove the ~directory-exa~ dispatcher like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq dirvish-preview-dispatchers (remove 'directory-exa dirvish-preview-dispatchers))
#+end_src

This makes Dirvish use the fallback directory previewer, Dired.

You may also want to create your own dispathers. Here is an sample dispatcher
to preview the =README.md= file in a directory:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(dirvish-define-preview readme (file)
  "Preview README.md file in a directory when exists."
  (when (file-directory-p file) ; we only interest in directories in this case
    (let ((readme-file (expand-file-name "README.md" file)))
      (when (file-exists-p readme-file) ; when the README.md exists
        ;; Instruct Dirvish to open the README file as preview
        `(buffer . (find-file-noselect ,readme-file t nil))))))

(add-to-list 'dirvish-preview-dispatchers 'readme)
#+end_src

If you find it useful, you can extend this dispatcher to support "README.org" or
make it case insensitive etc. Either way, it is good enough as a basic example.

Consult ~dirvish-preview-dispatch~ for details.

To change the preview dispatcher session-locally, see [[#Transient based help menu (dirvish-menu.el)][dirvish-menu]].

** Hooks

| Hook                       | Description                             |
|----------------------------+-----------------------------------------|
| ~dirvish-activation-hook~    | Hook for dirvish session activation.    |
| ~dirvish-deactivation-hook~  | Hook for dirvish session deactivation.  |
| ~dirvish-mode-hook~          | Hook for parent buffer initialization.  |
| ~dirvish-preview-setup-hook~ | Hook for preview buffer initialization. |

** Extensions
*** Transient based help menu (dirvish-menu.el)

This extension provides help menu powered by =transient.el= for Dirvish.

~dirvish-dispatch~ is the prefix to invoke the top-level help menu, just like
~magit-dispatch~ as to =magit= (see Figure 1. in [[https://github.com/alexluigit/dirvish/#screenshots][README.org]]). The menu contains most
of the built-in Dired commands and all of the Dirvish commands. Some sub-level
prefix commands such as ~dirvish-marking-menu~ were created because it makes sense
to group together the Dired/Dirvish commands that serve similar purposes.

An interesting prefix worth mentioning is ~dirvish-setup-menu~, because it enables
users to change the setup of a session on the fly (see Figure 4. in [[https://github.com/alexluigit/dirvish/#screenshots][README.org]])

The variable ~dirvish-menu-available-prefixs~ holds all available prefixs, bind
them in ~dirvish-mode-map~ if you like.

*** Multi-stage copy/pasting of files (dirvish-yank.el)

Here is a quote from [[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks][dired-ranger]] that justified the ~dired-ranger-move/paste~ commands:

#+begin_quote
A feature present in most orthodox file managers is a "two-stage" copy/paste
process. Roughly, the user first selects some files, "copies" them into a
clipboard and then pastes them to the target location. This workflow is missing
in dired.

In dired, user first marks the files, then issues the dired-do-copy command
which prompts for the destination. The files are then copied there. The
dired-dwim-target option makes this a bit friendlier---if two dired windows are
opened, the other one is automatically the default target.

With the multi-stage operations, you can gather files from multiple dired
buffers into a single "clipboard", then copy or move all of them to the target
location.
#+end_quote

The ~dirvish-yank~ command can do similar things as ~dired-ranger-move/paste~,
meanwhile, it has serveral benefits over ~dired-do-copy~ or ~dired-ranger~:

- It paste/move files using external processes, hence heavy I/O tasks won't
  block the main process of Emacs.
- It's much simpler than ~dired-ranger~ because you mark files using built-in
  Dired commands such as ~dired-mark~, ~dired-mark-extension~.
  
*** Minibuffer file preview (dirvish-peek.el)

~dirvish-peek-mode~ is an extension which provides ~dirvish-peek-mode~ to preview
file when narrowing file/directory candidates using minibuffer.

- Why does this feature exist? ::

  *Dirvish* and *minibuffer* seem unrelated at first glance. But when it comes to
  display a file preview, they actually share the same mechanism, that is: /get
  file path under the cursor and update preview window accordingly./ Displaying
  minibuffer file preview in a "dirvish" way, not only a lot of source code can
  be reused, but also related user configurations.  In other words, you don't
  have to configure file preview for dirvish and for minibuffer separately, they
  will always /display the same thing./

This extension is currently only available for *vertico/selectrum*.

*** Version-control (git) integration (dirvish-vc.el)

This extension provides:
- ~vc-state~ attribute
- ~git-msg~ attribute
- ~vc-diff~ preview dispatcher

See Figure 4. in [[https://github.com/alexluigit/dirvish/#screenshots][README.org]]. 

*** Extra commands, attributes, or preview dispatchers (dirvish-extras.el)
**** Commands

| Command                            | Description                              |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------------|
| ~dirvish-show-history~               | Navigate to recently visited directories |
| ~dirvish-other-buffer~               | Switch to most recent Dirvish buffer     |
| ~dirvish-find-file-true-path~        | Switch to most recent Dirvish buffer     |
| ~dirvish-copy-file-name~             | Switch to most recent Dirvish buffer     |
| ~dirvish-copy-file-path~             | Switch to most recent Dirvish buffer     |
| ~dirvish-copy-file-directory~        | Browse all directories using ~fd~ command  |
| ~dirvish-rename-space-to-underscore~ | Browse all directories using ~fd~ command  |
| ~dirvish-roam~                       | Browse all directories using ~fd~ command  |

**** Attributes

You don't need [[https://github.com/jtbm37/all-the-icons-dired][all-the-icons-dired]] anymore since dirvish have built-in icon
support. Rendering icons natively gives us better integration with line
highlighting and more room to optimize the performance (lazy rendering).

**** Customization options

| Option                      | Type    | Description                               |
|-----------------------------+---------+-------------------------------------------|
| ~dirvish-icon-size~           | Integer | Icon size used for =vscode-icon=          |
| ~dirvish-icon-delimiter~      | String  | The delimiter between icon and filename   |
| ~dirvish-icon-palette~        | Option  | Palette style used for =all-the-icons=    |

*** Toggle Dirvish in side window (dirvish-side.el)

Use ~dirvish-side~ command to toggle the side Dirvish.

Customize the option ~dirvish-side-scope~ to create scoped Dirvish session with
~dirvish-side~ command. For example,

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(customize-set-variable 'dirvish-side-scope 'perspective)
#+end_src

will make every =perspective= have an unique ~dirvish-side~ session. A valid scope
can be one of: ~emacs~, ~tab~, ~frame~, ~persp~ (see [[https://github.com/Bad-ptr/persp-mode.el][persp-mode]]), ~perspective~ (see
[[https://github.com/nex3/perspective-el][perspective-el]]).

Customize the option ~dirvish-side-display-alist~ to place the side session
wherever you want.
